# Clustering my Spotify Playlist using k-means
This is a rather simple project to take one of my larger Spotify playlists, the Hard Bop Jazz playlist from my profile, and to cluster the songs according to 3 of the parameters that Spotify records in their data set. The parameters I chose were Energy, Loudness, and Instrumentalness. See Spotify for their definition for each of these values. I then use a min max scaler transformation to make the data fit into the 3D scatter plot more neatly. My choice of n-clusters is more of a visual choice, as after plotting the data set it seems to be the more appropriate choice.
